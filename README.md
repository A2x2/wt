these are the files i used to animate my ["fan music video" of wavetapper by frums](https://youtu.be/kq_nzrr_ZdE)

automation was mainly by abusing `browser.window.create()` and `browser.tabs.move()` from the [firefox webextensions api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API)

note: if you try to run this yourself, you will very likely experience desync (ymmv)

note 2: i used [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to host the files on localhost, but any php webserver works

note 3: a good portion of the footage at the end is edited out so the video can end on time
